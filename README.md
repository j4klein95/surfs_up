# Surf's Up!

## Aloha! (Description):
- The following is an analysis of weather at one of my favorites states to live in, Hawaii. The goal to visualize precipitation, temperature frequency, and average temperature.

## How'd I do it?:
- I used numerous Python analysis libraries to conduct this project. I used SQL Alchemy to query the hawaii.sqlite database. I used pandas to turn these queries into dataframes and then into csv's. Then I used pandas again to clean the data and then numpy and matplotlib to visualize the data. Finally, I created app.py using the Flask library to host the data in JSON format.  


### Where to find what:
- You can find the data clean up process under Notebook/data_engineering.ipynb.

- You can find the database engineering process under Notebook/database_engineering.ipynb.

- You can find the analysis and visualizations under Notebook/climate_analysis.ipynb.

- You can find my climate API under climate_app.py. Run from the command line or terminal to make calls that returns data in JSON format.
